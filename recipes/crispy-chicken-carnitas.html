		<h3>Chicken:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
			<li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
			<li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
			<li>5 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
			<li>1 yellow onion, quartered</li>
			<li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
			<li>¼ cup chicken broth</li>
			<li>½ bunch cilantro</li>
			<li>1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, or more to taste</li>
			<li>1 orange, zested and juiced</li>
			<li>1 bay leaf</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Chipotle Sauce</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Chipotle Sauce</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
			<li>1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, or more to taste</li>
			<li>1 pinch salt</li>
			<li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 1</h3>
			</li>
		
			<p>TCombine cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle over chicken breasts on both sides.</p>
		
			<li>
				<h3>Step 2</h3>
			</li>
		
			<p>ATurn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil
			and sear chicken breasts, 1 to 2 minutes per side, working in batches so chicken sears rather than steams. Transfer
			chicken to a plate.</p>
		
			<li>
				<h3>Step 3</h3>
			</li>
		
			<p>Add garlic and onion to the hot cooker; cook and stir until browned evenly on all sides, about 2 minutes. Return chicken
			to the pressure cooker along with lime juice, chicken broth, cilantro, chipotle pepper with 1 tablespoon adobo sauce,
			orange zest and juice, and bay leaf. Close and lock the lid. Set timer for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on size of chicken
			breasts.</p>
		
			<li>
				<h3>Step 4</h3>
			</li>
		
			<p>Meanwhile, combine mayonnaise, milk, chipotle pepper and 1 tablespoon adobo sauce, salt, and garlic powder to an
			electric blender. Blend chipotle sauce until smooth.</p>

			<li>
				<h3>Step 5</h3>
			</li>
				
			<p>Release pressure from the cooker using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40
			minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</p>

			<li>
				<h3>Step 6</h3>
			</li>
					
			<p>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</p>

			<li>
				<h3>Step 7</h3>
			</li>
						
			<p>Transfer chicken breasts to a clean surface and reserve cooking liquid. Shred chicken meat using 2 forks. Place in a
			large bowl and drizzle 1/4 cup cooking liquid over chicken; toss to coat. Drizzle 1 tablespoon oil over the surface of a
			baking sheet. Add chicken to the sheet and drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon oil on top. Stir to coat evenly.</p>

			<li>
				<h3>Step 8</h3>
			</li>
							
			<p>Broil chicken in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Toss chicken with 1 to 2 tablespoons reserved cooking liquid and
			rotate the pan for even broiling. Continue broiling until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes more. Serve with chipotle sauce.</p>
