	<h2>Description</h2>
	
	<p>Creamy risotto with softened mushrooms and a sprinkling of cheese seems like a dish best ordered at a restaurant instead
	of made at home. That's because traditionally risotto is made slowly, stirring often, adding 1/4 cup of hot stock at a
	time, then more stirring. It's a labor-intensive dish that's worth the fuss. However, risotto made in a pressure cooker
	is so simple and quick that it feels like cheating. It's not. This is the real stuff. You'll probably start making
	risotto far more often after you try this one.</p>
	
	<h2>Ingridients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
			<li>4 thick slices cherrywood-smoked bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
			<li>2 ½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
			<li>1 cup water</li>
			<li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Garlic Base)</li>
			<li>1 ½ cups half-and-half</li>
			<li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>¼ cup sliced green onions</li>
			<li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 1</h3>
			</li>
		
			<p>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add onion, bacon, and
				butter to the hot pot and saute until bacon is crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Turn off Saute function and transfer contents
				to
				a small bowl.</p>
		
		<li>
			<h3>Step 2</h3>
		</li>
		
		<p>Add potatoes, water, and garlic base to pot and close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to
				manufacturer's
				instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</p>
		
		<li>
			<h3>Step 3</h3>
		</li>
		
		<p>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 15 minutes.
				Release
				remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Mash
				potatoes
				against the side of the pot, leaving some chunks if desired. Add onion-bacon mixture and half-and-half; stir to
				combine.</p>
		
		<li>
			<h3>Step 4</h3>
		</li>
		
		<p>Ladle into soup bowls and top with green onions, Cheddar cheese, and black pepper.</p>
	 </ol>
