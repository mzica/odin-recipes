	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>This potato soup cooks in an Instant Pot® and is customizable with assorted toppings. I prefer to get my saltiness from
	the bacon, so I don't add extra salt. I also like a thicker chowder-like consistency; if you like yours thinner, add
	more liquid.</p>
	
	<h2>Ingridients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
			<li>4 thick slices cherrywood-smoked bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
			<li>2 ½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
			<li>1 cup water</li>
			<li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Garlic Base)</li>
			<li>1 ½ cups half-and-half</li>
			<li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>¼ cup sliced green onions</li>
			<li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>

			<p>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add onion, bacon, and
			butter to the hot pot and saute until bacon is crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Turn off Saute function and transfer contents to
			a small bowl.</p>

			<li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>

			<p>Add potatoes, water, and garlic base to pot and close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's
			instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</p>
			
			<li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
			
			<p>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 15 minutes. Release
			remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Mash potatoes
			against the side of the pot, leaving some chunks if desired. Add onion-bacon mixture and half-and-half; stir to combine.</p>
			
			<li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>

			<p>Ladle into soup bowls and top with green onions, Cheddar cheese, and black pepper.</p>
		</ol>
