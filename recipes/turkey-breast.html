	<h2>Description</h2>
	
	<p>The Instant Pot® made the moistest turkey breast I have ever made. I usually let this cook in the slow cooker all day,
	but this turned out so much better. I couldn't believe that I had such a wonderful meal ready in less than an hour
	total!</p>
		
	<h2>Ingridients</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>1 (1 ounce) package onion soup mix</li>
			<li>1 (6 pound) turkey breast, thawed</li>
			<li>2 ribs celery, cut into large chunks</li>
			<li>1 onion, cut into large chunks</li>
			<li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons water</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon cornstarch, or more as needed</li>
			
		</ul>
			
	<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>

			<p>Sprinkle onion soup mix all over turkey breast and place in the pot of an electric pressure cooker (such as Instant
			Pot®). Place celery and onion chunks over and around turkey breast. Pour chicken broth over turkey breast.</p>
			
			<li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>

			<p>Seal pressure cooker and bring to high/low pressure on the 'Poultry' setting or according to manufacturer's
			instructions; cook until juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Release pressure through natural-release method for about
			20 minutes. Transfer turkey breast to a plate and slice.</p>
			
			<li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
			
			<p>Change the electric pressure cooker setting to 'Saute.' Mix water and cornstarch together in a bowl; add a small amount
			of hot liquid from the pot. Mix until dissolved; pour into the pot and whisk well until thickened, about 3 minutes.
			Serve gravy alongside turkey.</p>
